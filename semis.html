                <p>
                    21st-century innovation demands semiconductors, and many companies are cashing in on this. 
                    Even as the industry eases out of a shortage, demand is excessively high and is expected to stay that way through 2022 and beyond. 
                    As new growth drivers, like the metaverse, emerge, we will continue to put significant amounts of money to work, 
                    especially with valuations staying cheap.
