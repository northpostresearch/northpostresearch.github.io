                <p>
                    With Biden's trillion-dollar infrastructure deal passing in November, 
                    industrials look like an extremely attractive investment opportunity. 
                    However, the spread of the delta, omicron, and other future variants is throwing a wrench into these plans. 
                    Combining this headwind with high inflation and labor costs, 
                    we have been forced to turn cautiously bullish on the future despite the clear positive from lawmakers.
