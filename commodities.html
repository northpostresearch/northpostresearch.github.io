                <p>The attractive supply-demand imbalance have pushed commodity prices higher, allowing companies to hedge their products at far higher prices. These increasingly positive trends have been reflected through rapid earnings improvement in both Q1 2021 & Q2 2021. Our forecasts estimate that commodities will see the highest earnings improvement during the latter part of the year, meaning the best is yet to come for these stocks.</p>
