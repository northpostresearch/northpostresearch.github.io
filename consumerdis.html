                    Consumer Discrentionary
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Payrolls and consumer spending did vastly surprise to the upside towards the end of Q3, but it didn't make a dent
                    in consumer confidence as the good news was met with a macroeconomic reality check. With Student loan repayments slated 
                    to begin soon, meaning 13.6% of the total population will have to take more out of their budget, a percentage that
                    rises when considering labor force numbers. And with stubborn inflation primarily driven by rents, food, and gas,
                    which will be even more volatile following the Israel-Hamas war, essential costs are digging into 
                    consumers' pockets more than they can spend on discrentionary items. While travel and other services are attractive as
                    they normalize towards 2019 levels, the rebound will be short-lived as it faces similar headwinds.
