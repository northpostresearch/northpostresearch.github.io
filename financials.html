                    With tapering underway since November 2021, and multiple rate hikes upcoming in 2022, financials are the place to be.
                    Although the 10-Year Treasury rate did not make a significant move higher during Q4 2021, we believe this will soon change.
                    While investors should continue to be alert for delta and omicron variant-related economic setbacks, 
                    many tailwinds are in place to overcome it and help the sector excel.
